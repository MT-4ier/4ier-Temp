  "YangsThoughts": "The Brahma was designed after the Taurian Concordat was invaded during the Jihad. During that time, the Taurian Defense Force took heavy losses when they put their older machines up against the cutting edge technologies available to the Federated Suns. Though the Taurians were successful in driving the AFFS out of Taurian space and inflicted notable losses on the Federated Suns, the cost to the Concordat in men and mat√©riel was just too high. With that realization uppermost in their minds, the TDF commissioned a new BattleMech that would force the Taurian industrial community to upgrade their factories. If the factory wasn't able to build a component the designers wanted, the TDF reallocated funds to add that production capability to the factory. Thus the Brahma serves not only as a BattleMech for combat, but as a technology driver as well. Though the designers originally wanted a 55 ton 'Mech that would complement the Griffin, Shadow Hawk, and Wolverine, they were unable to fit all the technology in a medium 'Mech chassis. The Brahma therefore displaces sixty tons.",
